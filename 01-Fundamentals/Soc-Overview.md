SOC Overview
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit responsible for continuously **monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats** within an organization.
The main objective of a SOC is to **protect systems, networks, and data** by identifying security incidents at an early stage and taking appropriate action.
A SOC operates 24/7 and works with **security logs, alerts, and monitoring tools** to detect suspicious activities such as unauthorized access, malware infections, brute-force attacks, and phishing attempts.

* Monitor security alerts generated by security tools
* Analyze logs from Windows, Linux, network devices, and applications
* Identify and investigate potential security incidents
